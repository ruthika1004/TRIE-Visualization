TRIE Visualization
✨ Overview
This project provides an interactive visualization of the TRIE data structure. Users can insert words, search for words, find words with a given prefix, and retrieve all stored words. The visualization represents the TRIE in a structured tree format, making it easy to understand.

🚀 Features
-> Insert words into the TRIE.
-> Search for a specific word.
-> Find all words that start with a given prefix.
-> Retrieve and display all stored words.
-> Beautiful, interactive tree visualization.
-> Responsive and easy-to-use interface.

🌐 Demo
Live Demo -> 

🛠 Technologies Used
-> HTML - For structuring the page.
-> CSS - For styling and enhancing the user interface.
-> JavaScript - For implementing TRIE logic and visualization.

📖 Explanation of TRIE
A TRIE (Prefix Tree) is a data structure used for efficient retrieval of words, particularly for autocomplete and dictionary applications. Each node represents a character, and words are stored as paths from the root.

🎯 Why This Project?
This visualization helps beginners and developers understand how the TRIE structure works. By seeing the tree grow dynamically as words are added, users can better grasp how words are stored and retrieved efficiently.
